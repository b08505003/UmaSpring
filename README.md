## UmaSpring
This is a project built with Java Spring and Thymeleaf, connecting to MySQL.
A quiz game to guess japan racing horse (keiba) depend on their career (races they had run).

### Purpose
I hope to combine everything that I have learned in the Spring course, including
- JPA/hibernate: perform CRUD methods with database, using entity and entitymanager
- Thymeleaf: displaying views by passing model attributes
- Validation: check the input is valid
- Security: create authentication page to access to certain page
- Bootstrap: perform CSS (this is actually not in the course but I also looked it up a lot to get an OK appearance)

### Functionality
It is actually simple now.
- Start game
- Show list of horses that will appear in the quiz
- Manage data in MySQL (need authentication)

If possible, there's more things I want to add, both in game and management. But for now I will leave it like this.
